                Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers
                emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In
                a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage
                from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

                Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[6][7][8] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[9] But they often
                include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[9][6][10] However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions, it is
                primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[11][12][7] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this view, education is what educated
                persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of them.[11][12][7] However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as well as
                the social institutions involved in these processes.[12] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is related to the homonym
                ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of") and dūcō ("I lead, I conduct").

                Education is commonly subdivided into different types. The most common subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.[35][36][7][37] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.[38] A process of teaching
                constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different classes based on the student's
                age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Because of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally compulsory up to a certain age.[35][39] Non-formal and informal
                education differ from formal education due to their lack of such a governmental institutionalized framework. Non-formal education constitutes a middle ground in the sense that it is also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear
                purpose in mind, such as tutoring, fitness classes, or the scouting movement.[35][39][7] Informal education, on the other hand, happens in an unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to the environment. Unlike formal and
                non-formal education, there is usually no designated authority figure responsible for teaching.[36] Informal education is present in many different settings and happens throughout one's life, mostly in a spontaneous manner. This is how
                children usually learn their mother tongue from their parents or when learning how to prepare a certain dish by cooking together.[35][39][7] Some accounts tie the difference between the three types mainly to the location where the learning
                takes place: in school for formal education, in places of the individual's day-to-day routine for informal education, and in other places occasionally visited for non-formal education.[36] It has been argued that the motivation responsible
                for formal education is predominantly extrinsic, whereas it tends to be mainly intrinsic for non-formal and informal education.[36] The distinction between the three types is normally clear for the paradigmatic cases but there are various
                intermediate forms of education that do not easily fall into one category.[
